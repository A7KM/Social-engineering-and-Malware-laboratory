# Social-engineering-and-Malware-laboratory
 Basic laboratory aimed at demonstrating social engineering and malware analysis

# Pre-requisites
* 2 windows machines (can be any version)
* 1 kali machine
* 1 ubuntu machine (if it's too heavy, you can use kali to host the fake site)

# Network Diagram 
In this lab, we will use a simple architecture, focused only on the attack vector and the malicious files.

# Phising
Phishing often serves as a gateway to other types of cyber attacks, such as the installation of malware and spyware. By clicking on malicious links or providing data on fake websites, the victim can have their device infected with malicious software that

In our case, a person will be phished in order to get the target to access a malicious website with some types of malicious files

to create the phising, we could use automated tools or even do it manually and send it out.
For a better illustration, we'll use a possible phishing email as a sample, but it's not necessary for this lab to work.

## Social Engineering 
For the phising template, we need to understand what social engineering is all about

Regardless of whether we're dealing with targeted phishing or not, the phishing email is intended to target the person's psyche (either positively or negatively), so in order for the phishing to be accepted effectively, we have to go through topics that make people forget their responsibilities and focus only on the advantages or losses that the email is informing them about.

Good examples of possible subjects/topics for phishing emails are
* Changes to bank balances
* Blocking accounts
* Product promotions
